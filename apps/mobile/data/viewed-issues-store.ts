/**
 * In-memory LRU of recently viewed issue UUIDs, scoped per workspace.
 * Powers the chat composer's `@` suggestion bar — the "Recent" section
 * shows whatever the user opened in the issue detail view most recently.
 *
 * Why in-memory only (no SecureStore persist):
 *   - Recency is a session signal; cold-start clearing is fine UX
 *   - Avoids the cost of awaiting SecureStore on every issue open
 *   - Persistence can be a follow-up if users miss it
 *
 * Why per-workspace:
 *   - Viewing MUL-1 in workspace A shouldn't surface it in workspace B's
 *     chat — different agents, different context
 *
 * Capacity 10 per workspace: enough for "the last few things I looked
 * at" without overwhelming the suggestion list. We render at most 5 in
 * the chat suggestion bar; the extras buffer against the user opening a
 * couple of issues they don't end up referencing.
